As a student sharing documents for a team project
  I want to control how those documents are used
    So that I can't be accused of cheating

As a developer designing proprietary software
  I want to prove which files are mine
    So that other people can't claim credit for them

  I want to share ownership of my files
    So that they'll stay protected if I'm run over by a bus

  I want to unshare ownership of my files
    So that I can deal with co-developers who become untrustworthy

  I want to transfer ownership of my files
    So that I can release my source code to the open-source community
    So that I can sell my source code to another vendor
    So that I don't have to curate my own source code

As an open-source advocate
  I want to protect open-source files
    So that a commercial company can't steal

  I want to register files anonymously
    So that I don't have to "own" a file for it to be protected

As the recipient of transferred files
  I want to confirm transfer before they become "mine"
    So that I'm not forced to assume ownership of illegitimate files
    So that I can't be spammed

  I want to batch confirm transfers before they become "mine"
    So that I'm not overwhelmed by spam

  I want to batch cancel transfers before they leave my ownership
    So that I can quickly do damage control if my account is hijacked
